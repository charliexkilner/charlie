    <p>Influence WorldWide is a streetwear brand that was created in a ICT classroom when Gregg Cotter and Charlie Kilner needed a name for their group for a project. They loved the name, along with this and their love for streetwear in 2015 they descided to create a brand. Its much more than just a brand although. </p>

    <p>Stickers / Photos to stick and make a wall like Brandy Melville. This is good for the younger generation <13 that can't afford a hoodie for example. Still giving valuye to consumers in other ways and cresting brand image.</p>
